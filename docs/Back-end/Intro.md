# Intro to the Back-end

⚒ Our back-end is built using the ⚡ [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) ⚡ framework. 

We definitely would not have a fully functioning REST API (with [documentation!]((https://api.yumz.tisuela.com/))) if it wasn't for FastAPI's tool and aim to speed up development.

You can check out our REST API [here](https://api.yumz.tisuela.com/).

We get most of our data by quering [Yelp's GraphQL API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro).
